# CPU-Scheduling-Simulator
<br>
<br>
The simulator provides a platform for users to explore the characteristics and behavior of different 
CPU scheduling algorithms, including First-Come First-Served (FCFS), Shortest Job Next (SJN), 
Round Robin (RR), Priority Scheduling, and Multilevel Queue Scheduling. Users can configure 
parameters such as the number of processes, their arrival times, burst times, and priority levels, as 
well as system-specific parameters such as the time quantum for RR scheduling and the number 
of priority levels for priority scheduling.
